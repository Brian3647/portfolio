# Printer: A game about beauty, lies and survival.

## TL;DR

Printer it's an endless hero-survival game where you have to survive the world's glitches caused by deformation of color in the wild. It explores beauty and it's power on an old, dead species that used unknown technology to make the world happier.

## Obtaining resources

Obtaining resources can be made on the easy but slow or hard but fast way.

Fast but hard: You can enter a destroyed city to get resources. But you get exposed to more glitches and you could wake up a [guardian](#guardians).

Easy but slow: You can enter old bunkers with resources or find tools in the forests and use them to manually get resources. Then you can [use them to create new ones](#creating-resources).

## Heroes

You have the red, blue and green masters: the only survivors of a war that changed the world.

The red hero has the ability to unglitch special places, it's fast and has a lot of HP, but if he enters on a glitch, their HP and velocity will be reduced by 80%.

The green hero can't unglitch and doesn't have a lot of HP, but can heal himself by entering on a glitch, and when on it, it's velocity it's aumented by 20%.

The blue one doesn't get affected in any way by glitches, and it needs to use a special gem to unglitch, but he can fly by a couple of seconds and it's the fastest.

## Guardians

There are still some guardians alive in the cities that were used for defending the world in the war. They are really strong and can easily walk through glitched places. They are blind, but they can hear everything easily. They always live in the center of cities.

## Creating resources

On old bunkers you can find static machines that can create tools based on information papers that can be found on the cities.
