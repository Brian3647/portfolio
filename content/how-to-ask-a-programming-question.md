# 1. Don't ask to ask, just ask.

This is how you do __*not*__ start a question:

`Foobar123`: Any Java experts around?

What the person is actually asking is:

`Foobar123`: Any Java experts around who are willing to commit into looking into my problem, whatever that may turn out to be, even if it's not actually related to Java or if someone who doesn't know anything about Java could actually answer my question? 

Or this:

`Foobar123`: I have a question about Java but I'm too lazy to actually formalize it in words unless there's someone on the channel who might be able to answer it 

Just ask.
Example of how you do start a question:

`Foobar123`: I have an issue with *x*, here's what I tried and my error: ...

See [this web](https://dontasktoask.com/).

# 2. Code blocks

Please do __*not*__ send code this way:

`Foobar123`: Hi I have issue in Java here is code: System.out.println("Hello"};

In discord, you can send code blocks: see [this](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-).

# 3. Spelling

There's no problem if you say some things wrong, but please do __*not*__ be like this:

`Foobar123`: Hi i habe isues on Java

I'm not even a english native speaker but at least try to make the text readable.
